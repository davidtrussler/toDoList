Create HTML framework for app.

Keeping the app modular
Using basic MV* model

When document loads calls main.js

main.js sets up the input form

Use Singleton pattern to namespace the JS for the app

I have used stuff such as addEventListener which limits the cross-browser nature 
Also DOMContentLoaded
Generally prefer to do this and then build in alternatives for older browsers.
